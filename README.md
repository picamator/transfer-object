==========================
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Transfer Object (or further TO) Generator creates TO with:

- PHP 8.4 property Hooks
- FixedArray as a main storage
- Transformation from and to Array as well as between TOs
- Implementation `IteratorAggregate`, `JsonSerializable`, `Serializable`, `Countable` interfaces

TO Generator includes console commands:

- Build TOs based on `YML` defintions
- Build `YML` defintions based on `JSON`


Definition
----------
TO Defintion is an `YML` file, that can contains one or many defitiotions.

 - Each root level is a new TO name
 - Second level is a property name
 - Third level is a property type supporting only tww keys `type` and `collectionType`

For example, defintion for `CustomerTransfer` with two `string` properties

```yml
Customer:
    firstName:
        type: string
    lastName:
        type: string
```

### Defintion Types

| type                | Any TO name without prefix `Transfer`.                                                         | Generated property will have the coresponding TO type.               |
| collectionType      | Any TO name without prefix `Transfer`.                                                         | Generated property will have `ArrayObject` where each element is TO. |

Console Command
----------------
TO Generator console command `generate-transfer.php` is an one command Symfony application located in the root.

Localy it can be run as providing path to configuration file.

For instance Samples TO can be generated by executing:

```bash
docker compose run transfer-object-php composer generate-transfer -c /home/transfer/transfer-object/doc/Samples/config/generator.yml
```

See [Configuraation Sample](/doc/Samples/Generated) for more details.

### Configuration
Configuration file is an YML file.

| Key Name | Level  | Example | Description |
| `generator` | root | | Configuration name. |
| `transferNamespace` | first | `"Picamator\\TransferObject\\Samples\\Generated"` | TO namespace. |
| `transferPath` | first | `"/home/transfer/transfer-object/doc/Samples/Generated"` | Path where generated TO should be saved. |
| `definitionPath` | first | `"/home/transfer/transfer-object/doc/Samples/config/definition"` | Path where TO definition is located. |

See [Configuraation Sample](/doc/Samples/generator.yml) for more details.



Development Environemnt
-----------------------
TO Generator provides Docker environment with one container `transfer-object-php`.

In order to star working install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) first.

To start working following command should be executed:

1. Build containers: `docker compose build`
2. Start start container (will run coponser install): `docker compose up`

### Composer Scripts
Table bellow shows how to run specific composer srcripts on Docker Container
