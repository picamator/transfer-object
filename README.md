==========================
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Transfer Object Generator builds Transfer Objects (TOs) based on `YML` definitions.

For instance defintion bellow:
```yml
Customer:
  firstName:
    type: string
  lastName:
    type: string
```

uses to generate TO:
```php
$customerTransfer = new CustomerTransfer();
$customerTransfer->firstName = 'Jan';
$customerTransfer->lastName = 'Kowalski';
```
To see how TO works please open [try-samples.php](/doc/Samples/try-samples.php).

Definition file can be generated by using well structure array.
```php
$data = [
    'firstName' => 'Jan',
    'lastName' => 'Kowalski',
];
```
