Transfer Object Generator
==========================

Would you like to build Symfony-compatible Transfer Objects?

You're in the right place! üéâ

Imagine you have a Rest API response:

```json
{
    "firstName": "Jan",
    "lastName": "Kowalski"
}
```

Running the following interactive [console command](https://github.com/picamator/transfer-object/wiki/Console-Commands#definition-generate):

```console
$ ./vendor/bin/definition-generate
```

Generates a `YML` [definition file](https://github.com/picamator/transfer-object/wiki/Definition-File):

```yml
Customer:
  firstName:
    type: string
  lastName:
    type: string
```

Then, running another [console command](https://github.com/picamator/transfer-object/wiki/Console-Commands#transfer-generate):

```console
$ ./vendor/bin/transfer-generate [-c|--configuration CONFIGURATION]
```

Builds the Transfer Object:

```php
$customerTransfer = new CustomerTransfer();
$customerTransfer->firstName = 'Jan';
$customerTransfer->lastName = 'Kowalski';
```

Key Features
------------

**Symfony Compatability:**

 * includes Symfony console commands:
   * [TransferGeneratorCommand](/src/Command/TransferGeneratorCommand.php)
   * [DefinitionGeneratorCommand](/src/Command/DefinitionGeneratorCommand.php)
 * includes Symfony services:
   * [TransferGeneratorFacade](/src/TransferGenerator/TransferGeneratorFacade.php)
   * [DefinitionGeneratorFacade](/src/DefinitionGenerator/DefinitionGeneratorFacade.php)
 * supports Symfony request data mapping

**Transfer Object:**

* implements methods:
  * `fromArray()`
  * `toArray()`
  * `toFilterArray()`
* implements standard interfaces:
  * `IteratorAggregate`
  * `JsonSerializable`
  * `Countable`
* supports embedded and collection Transfer Objects
* supports PHP primitive data types
* supports:
  * `BackedEnum`
  * `DateTime`
  * `DateTimeImmutable`
  * `BcMath\Number`
* supports asymmetric property visibility
* integrates external Transfer Objects

Installation
------------

Composer installation:

```console
$ composer require picamator/transfer-object
```

Examples
---------

* [Definition Generator](/examples/try-definition-generator.php)
* [Transfer Generator](/examples/try-transfer-generator.php)
* [Advanced Transfer Generator](/examples/try-advanced-transfer-generator.php)

Usage Tests
-----------

Definition Files and Transfer Object generators have been tested against following APIs:

* [NASA Open Api](https://api.nasa.gov/neo/rest/v1/neo/2465633?api_key=DEMO_KEY)
* [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current#example_JSON)
* [Content API for Shopping](https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/guides/products/products-api?hl=en)
* [Frankfurter is a free, open-source currency data API](https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1/latest)
* [Tagesschau API](https://tagesschau.api.bund.dev)

### Scenario

1. Rest API response is used as a blueprint to generate Definition Files
2. Transfer Objects are generated based on Definition Files
3. Transfer Object instance is created with the API response
4. Transfer Object is converted back to the array
5. The converted array is compared with the API response

In all cases, data **100%** are matched ‚úÖ.
