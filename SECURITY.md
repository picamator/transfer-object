Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Transfer Object Generator, please report it using GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting feature.
This ensures that your report is handled confidentially and promptly.

To report a vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/picamator/transfer-object/security) of the repository.
2. Click on the "Report a vulnerability" button.
3. Fill out the necessary details about the vulnerability and submit the report.

### Important note

Please do not report security issues through public channels such as GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.
This ensures that security vulnerabilities are addressed quicky and do not pose a risk to users.
